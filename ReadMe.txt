Things to Consider:
	SAS produced different results for prediction values than R and Stata. We have tried to figure out the reason for this discrepancy.

	 There is no exact R-squared in ordinal logistic regression. Because of this there is no exact way to check the proportion of the variance that is predicted by the independent variables.

	Diagnostics can be difficult for ordered logit models.

	Empty or small cells can have an effect on the model that will make the model unstable or not run.

Results:
